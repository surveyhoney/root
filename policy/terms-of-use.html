Users can check the status of their account online by logging in and clicking the ‘History’ or ‘Manage Payouts’ tabs in SurveyHoney.com. While SurveyHoney maintains every effort to ensure that accounts are credited properly, it is the User’s responsibility to verify that their Coins have been credited accurately. If the User feels that the incentive amounts credited to the account is incorrect, the User must contact SurveyHoney by email within sixty (60) days following SurveyHoney’s alleged error and explain in full the basis of the dispute, including any relevant information that offers evidence of the discrepancy in question. Upon receipt of the User’s notice, SurveyHoney will open an internal case and notify the User of SurveyHoney’s decision to adjust or maintain the number of Coins credited to their account, as SurveyHoney deems appropriate, within thirty (30) days. If SurveyHoney needs additional time outside of the thirty days to adequately investigate the User’s claim, the Company will notify you via email and maintain best-efforts to provide a resolution as soon as reasonably practical. Any decision rendered by SurveyHoney with regard to such a claim is final.<br>‍</div>
